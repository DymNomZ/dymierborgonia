    <h2>About</h2>
    //insert video gta vc loading screen, and minecraft errors
    <p>*Minecraft error* "something child me would say". Little did little me know that the error has ignited the flame of curiousity 
        that would lead me into the field of programming. Today, I had the privilage to work with a _____ that offers website and 
        application services.

        Currently, I'm learning about DSAs and Object-Oriented Programming as a 2nd year College Student at CIT-U. I enjoy building
        software that are convenient and practical, but also quirky and random. If I have an idea, I'll go turn on my laptop and start
        coding whatever it is. During my spare time, I look up tutorials and documentations to be more knowledgeable on how certain 
        languages work and practice my programming skills on LeetCode.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not developing, I'm mostly surfing the web, playing obscure video games such as Roblox and of course Minecraft. I also 
        spend time with my friends and love ones, and if I'm lucky, I'll shoot some hoops on an empty basketball court on a cloudy day.
